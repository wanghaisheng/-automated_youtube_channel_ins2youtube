------

This project aims to automate the upload process for YouTube Videos. Since videos can only be publicly uploaded through the YouTube Data API by using a Google Workspaces Account (not free!), I decided to figure out a headless uploader using Selenium and Playwright. This approach also bypasses API restrictions (e.g. Rate Limits/Endcards can't be set through the API)
